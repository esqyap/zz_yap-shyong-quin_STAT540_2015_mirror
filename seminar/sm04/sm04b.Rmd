**Take-home Exercise: Can you modify the code above to answer this questions: which country gains the most growth in GDP in a 5-year interval? Between which 2 years?**

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

# load gapminder data
gd_url <- "http://tiny.cc/gapminder"
gtbl <- gd_url %>% read.delim %>% tbl_df
gtbl %>% glimpse

# country that gained the most growth in GDP in a 5-year interval
gtbl %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  select(country, year, continent, gdpPercap) %>%
  mutate(le_delta = gdpPercap - lag(gdpPercap)) %>%
  summarize(highest_le_delta = max(le_delta, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(min_rank(desc(highest_le_delta)) < 2)

# between which 2 years?
gtbl %>%
  filter(country == "Kuwait") %>%
  select(country, year, continent, gdpPercap) %>%
  mutate(le_delta = gdpPercap - lag(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(min_rank(desc(le_delta)) < 2)
```

**Kuwait is the country that gained the most growth in GDP per capita ($28452.98) in a 5-year interval (between 1967-1972).**
